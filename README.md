EcomXpress is a web application that is useful for shopping for items if you live far away from the Central Business District or if you don't have a choice but to stay in your place of residence. This web application came about as a result of getting Ahsesi students to easily buy good from Accra, which is miles away...

# User Flow
1. Sign in / Register to have an account with EcomXpress
2. Once signed in, you will be brought to the hompage, from here you can search in categories and find products to add to your cart.
3. If you find anything you like, add it to your cart and proceed to checkout where you can enter your details for delivery.
4. Our site does not process payments however, so the user flow ends here.
